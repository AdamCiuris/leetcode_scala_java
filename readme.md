<h4>Scala and java solutions from my leetcode practice.</h4> 

<h1>Scala</h1>

Scala solutions are pure functions. They should all be recursive, and produce the same output for the same inputs.
 I try to use as many functional programming methods as I can.

<h1>Java</h1>

I do these second, generally. They are influenced by the Scala solutions. If there is an easy way to solve a problem avoiding a totally functional solution I do it.

<h1>also</h1>
sometimes i just put whatever i want in here
